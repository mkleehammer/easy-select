# select-mode

An emacs mode for selecting with precision.

This is a minor mode that that supplies commands for selecting and working with the selection
(region).  It uses normal keys like "s" so it is a mode only enabled for short while, then it
disables itself automatically whenever you execute any command not in its keymap.
